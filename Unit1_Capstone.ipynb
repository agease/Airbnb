    "My idea is for AirBnB to run an experiment where certain listings are given an \"AirBnb Recommends\" tag. Similar to Amazon recommended products, this tag would likely drive higher utilization of recommended properties, and could be used to reward properties that have positive effects for Airbnb (e.g., lead to a higher usage of Airbnb Experiences in the city).\n",

    "- come up with an indicator of positive/negative sentiment based on the review table\n",
